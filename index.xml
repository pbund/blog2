TTCP is one of these.
TTCP (“Test-TCP”) is a hidden command available on most Cisco routers and switches. It can be used to test TCP connection speeds between Cisco devices, if both devices support it. It tries to send data as fast as possible (normal TCP behavior), but my tests show the speed is nowhere near the maximum link speed (it generated 22 Mbps on a 100 Mbps connection between two Catalyst 3560 switches).</description></item></channel></rss>
