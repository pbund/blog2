It’s usage seems to confuse users, including myself sometimes. So I did some reading and testing, and here’s what I found.
Note that EEM usually requires an event detector to be specified, i.e. CLI events, syslog events, routing events, etc. The sync argument is only used with the CLI event detector.</description></item><item><title>Fun with TTCP</title><link>https://pbund.github.io/blog2/posts/ttcp-121222/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 18:30:12 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://pbund.github.io/blog2/posts/ttcp-121222/</guid><description>I’ve always been interested in lesser-known or unusual Cisco commands. TTCP is one of these.
TTCP (“Test-TCP”) is a hidden command available on most Cisco routers and switches. It can be used to test TCP connection speeds between Cisco devices. It tries to send data as fast as possible (normal TCP behavior), but my tests show the speed is nowhere near the maximum link speed. But I use it to generate traffic to check if line errors are increasing, or maybe test QoS or ACL policies.</description></item></channel></rss>
